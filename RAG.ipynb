            "The Retention Bonus policy is a company policy that outlines the details of a bonus given to eligible employees. The bonus is calculated as 8.33% of the employee's Cost-to-Company (CTC) and is paid on a half-yearly basis, with cycles from April to September being paid in the October payroll, and cycles from October to March being paid in the April payroll. Employees with a defined Retention Bonus component in their Offer/Appraisal letter are entitled to this bonus, and they must complete a 6-month service period to be eligible. If an employee joins in the middle of a bonus cycle, they will not be eligible for the bonus corresponding to that specific cycle, and it will be issued along with the next cycle. In the case of maternity leave, if an employee's maternity leave starts from the middle of September, the retention bonus will be calculated only for the period of April to August (5 months) and paid once the employee returns to work after the maternity leave. If the maternity leave starts from or after October 1, the retention bonus will be calculated for the period of April to September and paid once the employee returns to work. However, the employee will not be eligible for the retention bonus for the period of October to March as they are on maternity leave. The HR department will proactively communicate policy details to eligible employees to ensure transparency and clarity regarding bonus entitlement.\n"
